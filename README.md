# Docker Server
Various config settings for linux server running docker. Inspired by @EDIflyer.

## Server
For this I'm using a Compute Engine VM on Google Cloud Platform. I've started with the e2-micro with 10Gb standard disc which is included in the free tier so shouldn't cost anything. (I've already got another of these running and it ends up costing me about 90p per month but I think that's because I configured the wrong storage.)

I'm running Debian 11.
